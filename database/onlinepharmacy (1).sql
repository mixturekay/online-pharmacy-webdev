This means it is used by women to prevent an unwanted pregnancy after unprotected sex or when a contraceptive method fails. Please note that this does not protect against the risk of HIV/AIDS and STIs. The Lydia Postpill is not to be used as a daily contraceptive option. Please contact your pharmacist or doctor or family planning clinic for a contraceptive method that suits you.\r\n\r\nHow does Lydia Postpill work?\r\nLydia Post pill may not prevent a pregnancy in 100% of cases but the tablets are more effective when taken within 72 hours (3 days). Preferably, within 12 hours after unprotected sex and not on the third day. Each Lydia postpill contains 0.75mg levonorgestrel BP, a progestin hormone.  It works mainly by;\r\n\r\nPreventing the release of an egg (ovulation) during your menstrual cycle. \r\nIt makes the vaginal fluid thicker to help prevent sperm from reaching an egg (fertilization).\r\nAnd changes the lining of the uterus (womb) to prevent attachment of a fertilized egg.\r\nSo, Lydia postpill stops pregnancy before it is established and does not work if you are already pregnant.\r\n\r\nBefore you take Lydia postpill\r\nPlease talk to your pharmacist before you take this medicine because emergency contraception might not be suitable for you.\r\nLydia postpill contains lactose. You should contact your doctor if you are lactose intolerant or intolerant to any other sugars.\r\nThere is not much data to support use in women less than 16 years, you must contact your doctor or family planning clinic for emergency contraception. Use of Lydia postpill emergency contraception before menarche is not indicated.\r\nYou can use Lydia Postpill at any time during the menstrual cycle unless menstrual bleeding is overdue. If your period is late, you should tell your pharmacist.\r\nBefore you take this medicine, your pharmacist may check that you are not already pregnant by asking you questions about your periods or when you had sex. If you or your pharmacist think that you might already be pregnant, you will need to have a pregnancy test.\r\nWhen you should not use this\r\nYou should contact your doctor for advice about emergency contraception if:\r\n\r\nyou have a disease of your small bowel (such as Crohn\'s disease) that interferes with the digestion of your food;\r\nyou have severe liver problems or diseases\r\nyou have severe renal problems or diseases\r\nyou are taking any of the medicines listed below, as these medicines may interact with Lydia postpill and lead to undesirable effects.\r\nBarbiturates and other medicines used to treat epilepsy (for example, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine etc).\r\nMedicines used to treat tuberculosis (for example, rifampicin, rifabutin).\r\nTreatment for HIV infection (e.g. ritonavir).\r\nA medicine used to treat fungal infections (griseofulvin).\r\nHerbal remedies containing St John\'s wort (Hypericum perforatum)\r\nCyclosporin which is used to help the immune system).\r\nLydia postpill contains the inactive ingredients: povidone k-25, polacrilin potassium, ethyl cellulose, maize starch, magnesium stearate, opadry white, you know you have and lactose. If you have an allergy to any of the ingredients of this medicine, please contact your doctor\r\nIf any of these apply to you Lydia postpill may not be suitable for you, or other types of emergency contraception may be better for you\r\n\r\nIf you are pregnant\r\nDo not take this medicine if you are already pregnant. If you had unprotected sex which was 72 hours ago or more and since your last period, you should take a pregnancy test to find out if you are pregnant. If your last period was more than 5 days late, your menstrual bleed was unusually light or heavy, you should check with your doctor to know whether you are pregnant.\r\n\r\nIf you become pregnant after you have taken the emergency contraceptive oral pill, you should contact your doctor. In case of failure of this emergency contraception and developing pregnancy, no evidence indicates any harm to the foetus but your doctor would want to check if there has been a development of an ectopic pregnancy. Especially, in women with severe abdominal pain or fainting or if there is a history of ectopic pregnancy, surgery or pelvic inflammatory disease\r\n\r\nWhen to take special care with Lydia Postpill\r\nBreastfeeding\r\n\r\nThe active ingredient may be present in small amounts breastmilk when breastfeeding. It is not thought to be harmful to the baby but if you are uncomfortable with that, you can take it after you are done breastfeeding your child. That way, you will have less amount of the drug the baby may take in the breastmilk\r\n\r\nIf you are taking any other medicines\r\n\r\nTell your pharmacist or contact your doctor if you are on any other medications before taking this drug. If you are not sure of anything, check with your pharmacist, family planning clinic or doctor.\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure of contracting a sexual transmitted disease\r\n\r\nEmergency contraceptives do not protect against an infection of a sexual transmitted disease, only condoms (a barrier contraceptive method) can prevent that. If you need more information on how to avoid sexual transmitted disease or HIV/AIDs, you should talk to your pharmacist, doctor or family planning clinic.\r\n\r\nHow to take Lydia Postpill\r\nThe treatment consists of two tablets\r\n\r\nSwallow the first tablet as soon as possible within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse or as soon as a known contraceptive failure is suspected.\r\nThe second tablet should be taken 12 hours (and no later than 16 hours after the first tablet). The emergency contraceptive will work effectively only if the first tablet is taken as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure.\r\nIf you are already using a regular method of contraception such as the contraceptive pill, you can continue to take this at your regular times.\r\nWhat to do if you vomit the pill\r\nIf you vomit within two hours of taking the tablet, take another tablet. Contact your doctor, pharmacist or family planning clinic upon vomiting after taking this drug and taking another dose.\r\n\r\nWhat to do if you take too many pills\r\nJust ask your doctor, pharmacist or family planning clinic for advice if you have taken too many tablets, especially if you feel sick afterwards.  There have been no reports of serious harmful effects from taking too many tablets at once. Although, you may feel sick (vomit), or have vaginal bleeding\r\n\r\nHow often can i take the Lydia Postpill?\r\nYou should only use Lydia postpill in emergencies and not as a regular method of contraception. The reason being it can upset your normal menstrual cycle (period).\r\n\r\nYou should contact your doctor, family planning clinic or pharmacist for long-term contraceptive options. These are more effective in preventing you from getting pregnant.'),

Our products are intelligently designed to work as hard as you do. We make it our business to know more about sweat, and what we learn informs every product innovation. Sweat, also known as perspiration, is a normal and healthy bodily function and it starts to occur just a few months after birth. We mainly sweat to cool our bodies down, a process called thermoregulation. Our brain sends a signal to over 3 million glands in our body to release sweat (a clear fluid made of water, salts and proteins). As this fluid evaporates from our skin, it lowers our body temperature. Rexona entered the world of professional sports, backing some of the world’s best sports men and women. To this day, Rexona continues to provide ultimate protection at even the busiest of times. Rexona was created in Australia in 1908 by Mrs Alice Sheffer, the wife of SF Sheffer, the founder of the Sheldon Drug Company. A talented physician, she wanted to give people a new kind of personal care product, with effective ingredients that also smelt good.

It also features Omron’s 3-in-1 function that enables you to measure the temperature of the room as well as surface temperature.\r\n\r\nWith a memory capable of recording up to 25 readings, it’s possible to track temperature changes over a period of time and monitor trends. Temperatures can be displayed on the large LCD display in either degrees centigrade or Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nImportance of Monitoring Temperature\r\n\r\nFever is one of the most important vital body signs. We tend to think of normal body temperature as being around 37 degrees and, while this can vary slightly, it’s fairly accurate in most cases. Maintaining this temperature at a constant level is important to ensure effective operation of the brain, vital organs and main arteries.\r\n\r\nAny significant rise in temperature usually indicates that the body’s immune system is defending itself against intruders, such as aggressive bacteria or viruses. Once the presence of a fever has been established, appropriate steps can quickly be taken to identify and eliminate the cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nEasy to Use\r\nActivates at the touch of a button, just hold the sensor 1-3 cm away from the surface you wish to measure, press the start button and you get a reading in one second.\r\nFor the Whole Family\r\n\r\nSuitable to use for whole family, the Gentle Temp 720 is compact and versatile and gives a one second measurement time.\r\n\r\nIn the Box:Main unit, test battery, probe lens cap, manual');
